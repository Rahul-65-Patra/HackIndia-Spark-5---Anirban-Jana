This project enables decentralized image uploading and sharing on the blockchain, leveraging Solidity for smart contract development and React for the front-end interface. It allows users to securely upload images to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) while ensuring that only authorized individuals can access and view the content through smart contract functionality. Additionally, the platform offers immutable record-keeping of uploads, enhancing trust and transparency. It also supports granular permission settings, enabling users to manage access rights to their images seamlessly. By integrating Web3 authentication, the platform ensures that interactions remain decentralized and secure, providing a user-friendly experience for managing digital assets on the blockchain.
